Aim here is to simulate a Car Rental Business. The rental store has certain number of cars spread across different categories available for renting. The customer can customize the cars with options such as addition of child car seats etc. before they rent. There are three types of customer, each customer type has its own limits on the number of cars and number of days the customer can rent the car.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Build Instructions}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Project is completely written in Java as per the problem requirement. The source code has been organized as per \href{https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html}{\texttt{ Maven Standard}}. This repository has been provided with a pom.\+xml file which the configuration file required by \href{https://maven.apache.org/}{\texttt{ Maven}} to compile the code. Building, testing and running the project is very easy with Maven\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First clone this repository to your local development environment. If you have access to a terminal, type in below command to get a local copy of the repository\+: {\ttfamily git clone git@github.\+com\+:Master\+J\+E\+E\+T/car-\/rental.\+git}
\item If you are using an I\+DE such IntelliJ, load this project into it. The I\+DE should automatically pick up the pom.\+xml configuration file and create its own configurations. After this you should be able to build and test the project the usual way it\textquotesingle{}s done in the I\+DE. Note\+: this works only if your I\+DE supports Maven integration.
\item Alternatively, if you are on a terminal and just cloned the repository, make sure you have Maven installed. In Cent\+OS, or any other Linux based OS with yum tool in it, one could to {\ttfamily sudo yum install maven} to install Maven. Then, go to project directory and execute {\ttfamily mvn package} to build the project. A sample run of the simulation has been provided in the file \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{car-rental-output_8txt}{car-\/rental-\/output.\+txt}}\textquotesingle{}. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Implementation Details}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Source code has been organized as per Maven Standard. All the project source files reside in the directory {\ttfamily src/main/java} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{MyUnitTest_8java}{My\+Unit\+Test.\+java}}} for testing the simulator is kept in {\ttfamily src/test/java} directory. The class {\ttfamily Car\+Rental} acts as the interface between the store and the customer. When new rental requests need to be made, just call the {\ttfamily add\+New\+Rental(\+Transaction)} method of{\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Car\+Rental} class and when car needs to be returned, just call {\ttfamily complete\+Rental(\+Transaction)}. The {\ttfamily Car\+Rental} class delegates the task to {\ttfamily Recorder} which has an instance of {\ttfamily Business\+Rule}. The {\ttfamily Recorder} in turn delegates all the validation task to {\ttfamily Business\+Rule}. The {\ttfamily Business\+Rule} verifies the data coherency and validates the request against the limits set on customer types and car availability. If all is good, the {\ttfamily Recorder} stores the transaction in its internal maps. We\textquotesingle{}ve used four design patterns in this project, each has been briefly described below. Check the {\ttfamily docs} to know more about the classes involved. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Factory Method Pattern}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
We\textquotesingle{}ve used Factory Method Pattern to create concrete {\ttfamily Car}s. The abstract class {\ttfamily Store} has the parameterized abstract method {\ttfamily get\+New\+Car(Car.\+Type car\+Type)} which takes in the required type of the {\ttfamily Car} as an argument. This method is implemented by {\ttfamily Car\+Rental} which extends {\ttfamily Car}. Argument is checked in a switch case statement and appropriate concrete {\ttfamily Car} is created and returned. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Decorator Pattern}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Decorator pattern has been used to add variable number of options to the {\ttfamily Car}. The {\ttfamily Car} has the abstract method {\ttfamily get\+Rental\+Cost(\+Integer num\+Of\+Days)}. The abstract class {\ttfamily Car\+Option} extends the {\ttfamily Car} and has an instance variable of type {\ttfamily Car}. The concrete car options class such as {\ttfamily Child\+Seat} override the {\ttfamily get\+Rental\+Cost} method appropriately to get correct cost. The concrete {\ttfamily Car} classes also override {\ttfamily get\+Rental\+Cost}. {\ttfamily Car}s are decorated inside a method {\ttfamily decorate\+Car()} of class {\ttfamily Car\+Rental} with specified number of each options (child seats, G\+PS modules and radio packages). \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Observer Pattern}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
This pattern has been used to create report at the end of each day. The {\ttfamily Observable} and the {\ttfamily Observer} interface has been created instead of using the inbuilt ones provided by Java. The {\ttfamily Store} implements the {\ttfamily Observable} and the {\ttfamily Summarizer} implements the {\ttfamily Observer} interface. Whenever there\textquotesingle{}s a need to create a report, the {\ttfamily Store} calls {\ttfamily update(\+Object)} on {\ttfamily Summarizer}. The {\ttfamily Summarizer} then generates the report. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Singleton Pattern}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
In addition to above three, the Singleton Pattern has also been implemented. The {\ttfamily Unique\+I\+D\+Generator} class has the responsibility of generating unique strings which can be used as identifier for all sorts of objects. Specifically it has been used to get transaction ID, customer ID, license plate number, report ID.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Test Cases}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{MyUnitTest_8java}{My\+Unit\+Test.\+java}}} class for unit test has been provided which contain 11 simple test methods. If your I\+DE supports Maven integration then you should be able to run your tests from the I\+DE itself. If you\textquotesingle{}re using a terminal, in the project directory just type {\ttfamily mvn test} to verify all is well. Sample output of tests done using Maven has also been provided in the file \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{maven-test_8txt}{maven-\/test.\+txt}}\textquotesingle{}.
